# Design Tokens in Modern Frontend

Design tokens are the foundation of any scalable design system. They help maintain consistency across platforms and make updates more manageable.

## What Are Design Tokens?

Design tokens are the smallest units of design decisions. They represent colors, spacing, typography, and other visual properties in a platform-agnostic way.

## Implementation Strategies

1. **Token Organization**
   - Category-based structure
   - Semantic naming conventions
   - Platform-specific transformations

2. **Build Process Integration**
   - Style Dictionary
   - CSS Custom Properties
   - Theme switching support
