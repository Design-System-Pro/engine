# Building Accessible Design Systems

Creating truly inclusive design systems requires more than just following WCAG guidelines. Let's explore how to bake accessibility into your design system from the ground up.

## Why Accessibility Matters

Design systems serve as the foundation for digital products. When we prioritize accessibility at this level, we ensure that all downstream applications inherit these inclusive practices.

## Key Principles

1. **Semantic HTML**: Always start with proper HTML structure
2. **ARIA attributes**: Use them sparingly and only when necessary
3. **Keyboard navigation**: Ensure all components are fully operable without a mouse
4. **Color contrast**: Build a color system that meets WCAG 2.1 standards

## Implementation Tips

- Test components with screen readers during development
- Include accessibility requirements in component documentation
- Provide clear guidelines for component implementation
