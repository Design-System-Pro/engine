# Design System Documentation Best Practices

Good documentation is what transforms a component library into a true design system. Let's explore how to create documentation that serves both designers and developers.

## Documentation Structure

1. **Getting Started**
   - Installation guides
   - Basic principles
   - Contributing guidelines

2. **Component Documentation**
   - Usage examples
   - Props/API reference
   - Accessibility considerations
   - Do's and Don'ts

## Maintenance Strategy

- Keep docs close to code
- Automate what you can
- Regular review cycles
- Version control for documentation
